# Infantry-training-system
Practical engineer final project. (Code language: C++)

The system consists of two sub-systems:
1. An Assault-rifle-like transmitter, requiring all operations required for ordinary assault rifles including a final stop and a first stop, transmitting with a laser beam.
2. A receiver consists of 4 jumping and moving targets and an LCD screen showing the results of the training, receiving with LDR.
* The weapon system is built on logical gates and flip-flops alone.
* The target system is based on the macro processor of the 8051 series.
* I have put emphasis on the environment and 80% of the project was made using recycled scraps (electronic as well).
